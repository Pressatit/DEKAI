# Geothermal Energy Training and Research Institute (GeTRI)
The abbreviation of Geothermal Energy Training and Research Institute is GeTRI

The director of the Geothermal Energy Training and Research Institute is : Dr. Patrick Chege Kariuki

**Need for GETRI**
One of the pillars in attaining Kenya’s Vision 2030 is provision of adequate and reliable energy supply. Geothermal has been identified as a potential resource as it is indigenous, plenty and “green”. The geothermal industry relies on a spectrum of professionals with varying technical backgrounds and experience. No geothermal training institutions exist in Africa. In spite of the high rate of the development of Geothermal Energy resource in Kenya, the development of Training and Research capacity, especially in the local universities has been hitherto lacking. This has led to a high dependency on experts from foreign universities and institutions to provide training and cover research needs.
For quite a while now, there have been discussions on the possibilities of setting up a geothermal training centre (in one of the countries in the East Africa region) to offer training in all aspects of geothermal technology from exploration through development to power station operations. The second aspect of the training centre was envisaged to serve as a research and scientific and engineering instrument pool for use by Eastern African countries to promote geothermal energy as a cheap source of renewable energy. Finally, such an institution would be used for data archiving. The data would include publications and reports on geothermal worldwide, activities in the region, an inventory of personnel with their expertise and available equipment in the region.
Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) has taken the challenge and established the Geothermal Energy Training and Research Institute (GeTRI). The institute has been founded as a response to an existing need in the geothermal industry (within Kenya and beyond) in developing capacity to exploit this energy resource. GeTRI is expected to become both the national and regional centre of excellence in geothermal training and research; offering the first-ever comprehensive program that brings together world-class experts to teach all elements of geothermal energy from resource discovery to utilization, including drilling, reservoir engineering, plant design, environmental impact and applicable business principles. Its core service areas include postgraduate training, research, publication, seminars & conferences in close collaboration with the geothermal industry, local and international universities. Initially, the Institute will have programmes at MSc level and, later, PhD level. The programs will continually be evaluated in line with the University’s strategic plans and the demands by industry. The trainings place emphasis on modern techniques of surface exploration, drilling, resource assessment and management; but they also offer sound knowledge on traditional techniques. Students are given a hands-on experience by being attached to either KenGen of GDC, the main industry players. At the end of the geothermal training program, the graduate is expected to:
  * Have a common foundation in multi-disciplinary Geothermal Energy Technology knowledge, that supports Geothermal Energy management.
  * Apply the acquired knowledge and skills to identify problems and provide solutions through relevant data collection analysis and interpretation to the various challenges of Geothermal Energy exploration & exploitation.


  1. Effectively participate in Geothermal Energy decision making process and effectively communicate in Geothermal Energy matters.

**Background to Geothermal Energy**
Geothermal energy is heat from within the earth. This heat is continuously being produced by processes in the subsurface and stored in rocks. When cold water comes into contact with these hot rocks, geothermal reservoirs are formed which when drilled into and fluids brought to the surface can be used to produce electricity, heat buildings and greenhouses and for other purposes. The most active geothermal resources are usually found along major plate boundaries where earthquakes and volcanoes are concentrated. The East African Rift Valley that runs through Eritrea, Djibouti Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique is endowed with enormous amounts of geothermal resources as manifested by volcanic eruptions and geothermal manifestations (hot springs, fumaroles, geysers). This indicates the presence of a remarkable geothermal potential in the region and therefore presents an opportunity for major geothermal power developments in these countries.
A good number of these East African countries have taken keen interest in the development of geothermal energy. Kenya is leading in the region in the development of this indigenous resource, largely due to government commitment and well trained workers. In fact, it is among the 1st ten countries in the world that generates electrical power from geothermal resources, currently standing at about 273 MWe against an estimated total potential of over10,000 MWe. Olkaria geothermal field is so far the largest potential site with current installed capacity of 269 MWe from three power plants owned by Kenya Electricity Generating Company (155 MWe) and Orpower4 (110 MWe) and Oseria (4 MWe). Production drilling is currently taking place at the Menengai geothermal field for 125 MWe power developments. Detailed exploration and drilling are planned for prospects in Suswa, Longonot, Baringo, Korosi, Paka and Silali volcanic fields.
Apart from electricity generation, geothermal resources are also being used directly. Some of the projects on direct use include the Oserian flower farm which has a 50-acre cut flowers farm under geothermal heated greenhouses using 18MWth. Other direct uses of geothermal energy in Kenya include a spa and swimming pool at Olkaria geothermal project and at Lake Bogoria. Other minor uses are for drying pyrethrum at Eburru and water harvesting at Eburru and Suswa.
Ethiopia follows Kenya in development of this resource. A 7.2 MWe net capacity pilot plant was installed in the country which operated for a short while before encountering operational difficulties that were essentially due to lack of appropriate field and plant management skills. In the last couple of years interest has again picked up. The Aluto Langano Power plant is being refurbished, more wells being drilled in this geothermal field and elsewhere in the country’s rift valley.
Zambia has had a mini geothermal pilot binary power plant of 200 KW capacity since the 1970’s which was installed on the basis of limited exploration work. The plant, however, never became operational due to lack of trained manpower. Plans are now in place to restore the plant and make it operational. Djibouti has drilled about six exploratory wells in the Assal geothermal field and intercepted a very high temperature system. However, due to the high salinity of the encountered fluids, the resource development has been delayed, till funds are available to apply proposed technical solutions to the salinity problem. Other countries in the region have carried various but limited reconnaissance surveys. The geo-scientific studies have resulted in identification of viable prospects in each of the countries which have been given priority for exploratory drilling. Rwanda is currently drilling its first exploration wells.
