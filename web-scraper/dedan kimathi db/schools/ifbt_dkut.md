Welcome to the Institute of Food Bioresources Technology (IFBT) at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology. The institute’s mission is to provide an academically stimulating culturally diverse and quality learning environment that fosters research, innovation, and technology development towards producing relevant technical and managerial human resource and leaders to contribute to the attainment of national development goals.
The institute offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs in Food science and technology as well as undergraduate program in Nutrition and dietetics. There is also certificate and diploma programs in coffee technology cupping and quality management. All the Bachelors programs are accredited by the Commission for University Education (CUE). The program of Nutrition and Dietetics is also accredited by the Kenya Nutritionists and Dietitians Institute (KNDI). Our postgraduate programs attract students locally and from other countries in the region. Currently we have students taking MSc Food science and technology from Rwanda, and Malawi. In our next cohort we expect students from Ethiopia, Uganda and Nigeria. Our programs are up to date with the market requirements and aligned with the national development agenda and, by extension, the global sustainable development goals, which aim to ensure food security and nutrition and alleviate hunger.
Through our programs students get hands-on experience through practical skills, industrial visits and internal attachments in our well-equipped food workshop. In addition there is also external attachments for our undergraduate students for more practical experiences. For instant student taking Bachelor of Food science and technology has to go for industrial attachment for 3 months in a Food processing facility. Similarly students taking Bachelor of Nutrition and dietetics has both community and clinical practicums in a hospital for a duration of 3 months each. The students in the institute have clubs and associations which help them utilize the knowledge they have gain from their programs into practice as they offer services to the community. This includes clubs such as DeFTeNSA (DeKUT Food Technology and Nutrition Students’ Association) as well as the Green Thumb Movement (GTM) focussing on agriculture and value addition. Students taking Nutrition and dietetics normally participate in the health week organize at the university every year to provide nutrition and dietetics services to the university community. This entails offering health related advices to clients on how to overcome health challenges affecting people in society.
Students graduating with BSc Food science and technology have opportunities to get employment from sectors such as food industries, government ministries, research institutions, universities, NGOs, self-employment etc. Students who also graduate with BSc Nutrition and dietetics also have opportunities to work in hospitals as clinical, community nutritionist or dieticians, in government ministries, NGOs, research institutions, universities or self-employment as consultants among others.
We have qualified staff in our institute who are committed to teaching as well as undertake research and innovation activities in different aspects of food science, nutrition and dietetics fields. We also have two centres at the institute formed to carry out research and innovation as they seek for funding from external bodies to facilitate the research activities This include the Coffee Technology Centre and the Centre for Food Safety and Naturopathy (CeFoNa).
Please explore the institute website for more information about us. Should you have any inquiries, kindly email us at ifbt@dkut.ac.ke.

Professional opportunities for a graduate in Food Science and Technology

Food analyst in food quality control laboratories – test foods for quality and safety in laboratories of food processors (like Coca-Cola, BIDCO, DELMONTE, and Bakeries) and government agencies like Kebs and Government Chemist.
Food process supervisor or food production manager– ensuring food processing is done per the requirements of food processing companies.
Food processing factory manager – ensuring that food processing and all other support activities are carried out per set requirements in food processing companies.
Food processing and food product development Consultant – being outsourced to provide expertise, e.g. research, training, policy formulation, safety, and quality in the food processing industry.
Training and teaching – in colleges and universities offering courses in food science and technology as tutors, lecturers, and laboratory technicians. To teach food science and technology in university, one has to do a postgraduate degree (in food science and technology). To teach in technical colleges, one had to have a postgraduate diploma in education.
Advocacy – highlighting, defending, and promoting food science and technology issues. For example, they advocate for the right to safe foods by food consumers and enlighten them on what entails safety and quality in processed foods.

**Professional opportunities for Nutrition and Dietetics graduates**

Clinical nutritionist- you practice in a hospital where you interact with patients one on-one. You assess, diagnose, offer nutrition counseling and education, and monitor them daily. Your work here is like that of a doctor, the only difference being that you don’t prescribe drugs but supplements, some special feeds, therapeutic feeds, parenteral, and enteral; you’ll learn the difference in all these feeds once you start learning how to prescribe them.
Community nutritionists- here, you deal with the community and enlighten them on the challenges they could be facing. Here, it varies based on your target group; again, you’ll learn more about it in class. Here, you can work very well with NGOs.
Dietitians- here, you become an expert in the specific amounts of nutrients every individual requires based on their condition, age, and gender. For example, what does a pregnant woman need in her first trimester, what amount of protein, vitamins and which ones, etc, maybe a patient in ICU based on their condition, age, etc
Training and teaching- You work in colleges and universities offering nutrition courses as a tutor, lecturer, lab technologist, or clinical instructor.
Advocacy/activism- highlighting, defending, promoting, and creating nutrition awareness among the population. For example, enlightening the community on how to avoid and manage lifestyle diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney failure, among others.
Nutrition consultant- with the knowledge gained after campus, you can decide to specialize in a particular field and set up your clinic, e.g., pediatric nutrition clinic, cancer specialist, kidney diseases specialist, etc. Your passion will determine that.
Research—Now that nutrition is an ever-changing and growing field, there are always many research opportunities coming up. Nutrition needs keep changing, and researchers must be updated with whatever is happening in the community. That’s why you hear from time to time, for example, that all pregnant mothers will need iron supplements, vitamin A in children, or some other Vitamins for school-going children, etc. All these come up out of research done.
Self-employment/business – use the technical knowledge acquired to start and run a food handling and processing business. A graduate in nutrition and dietetics will have acquired knowledge of dietary formulation and healthy food development.
