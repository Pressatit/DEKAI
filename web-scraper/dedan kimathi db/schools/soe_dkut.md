The school is headed by: **Dean, Dr. Njenga Mburu** who is the dean of School of Engineering

The DeKUT School of Engineering offers you a chance to learn the technical skills necessary to tackle the biggest challenges. Our vision is in line with the Universities’ Vision, of being a premier technological university excelling in quality education, research and technology. We have well equipped engineering workshops and labs click to view. Since we’re among the few accredited universities in Kenya, our graduates compete fairly well globally. The school also has a number of collaborations with premier foreign Universities in which some of our students benefit from the exchange programs. This offers our students a life-changing experience and relevant exposure to the best engineering practices. The school is well endowed in terms of both academic and non academic members of staff 

Understanding that 21st century engineers require more than technical knowledge, we equip students with an understanding of the social and economic impact of their work, the ability to communicate their ideas to a wide variety of people, the ability to work effectively in teams, and the skills to provide leadership in solving society’s emerging and existing problems. Our students are immersed in hands-on learning through design-based classroom and Industrial experiences, undergraduate and graduate research, study abroad through exchange programs, Industrial attachments and internships. The DeKUT School of Engineering therefore offers a range of undergraduate programs as well as post graduate programs
