The abbreviation of Institute of Geomatics, GIS & Remote Sensing is IGGReS
The director of Institute of Geomatics, GIS & Remote Sensing (IGGReS) is Dr. Mark K. Boitt
**WELCOME NOTE FROM THE DIRECTOR of Institute of Geomatics, GIS & Remote Sensing**
The Institute of Geomatics, GIS and Remote Sensing (IGGReS) is located on the second floor of the Resource Centre (RC) in the Main Campus – Nyeri. The academic staff is composed of full professors, Associate Professors, Senior Lecturers, Lecturers and Assistant Lecturers / Tutorial Fellows. Moreover, the non-teaching staff is fully composed of technologist who are conversant with the use of latest technological equipment for training and research. The institute has a staff of 14 lecturers and 6 technologists with an average annual student population of about 400 undergraduate students, 30 master’s students and 10 PhD students.
The institute offers two undergraduate degree programs and two postgraduate programs as follows: _Bachelor of Science in Geomatics Engineering and Geospatial Information Systems (5-years) Bachelor of Science in Geospatial Information Science and Remote Sensing(4-years) Master of Science in Geospatial Information Systems and Remote Sensing (2-years) Doctor of Philosophy in Geomatics and Geospatial Information Science (3-years)_
All our degree programs covers all aspects of the geospatial knowledge and skills that cut across the areas of land & Engineering Surveying, Geodesy, Hydrographic Mapping, Satellite Positioning, Remote Sensing, Digital Photogramme try & UAV Mapping, Geographic Information Systems, Cartography, Cadastral Surveying and Land Information Management among others.
Our programs are fully recognized by the Institution of Surveyors of Kenya (ISK) and the Land Surveyors Board of Kenya (LSB). With an extension, particularly on those special cases that apply geospatial technologies in environmental matters, they are also recognized by the Environment Institute of Kenya (EIK). Our students after graduation find themselves in government organizations, non-governmental organizations, private companies among many other organizations both locally and internationally.
The Institute conducts research, innovations and consultancies through one of its arms known as the Centre of Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS) in the various thematic areas that aim at solving issues related to development and society related matters. Through the Centre, the institute has seen research being undertaken, publications in peer reviewed journals and even creating opportunities for young researchers to thrive in their academic progressions and career capacity development.
